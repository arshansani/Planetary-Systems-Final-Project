# Planetary Systems Final Project

## Overview
This Flask-based web application interfaces with the NASA Exoplanet Archive, allowing users to fetch and store exoplanet data in a Redis database, retrieve it based on various criteria, and visualize planet size distributions through asynchronous job submissions. Additionally, users can query information about host stars and discovery facilities associated with the exoplanet data. The application provides a RESTful API documentation endpoint for easy reference to available functionalities. It is deployed using Kubernetes for scalability and reliability.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on host machine
- Internet connection

### Data Source
- The Planetary Systems data is sourced from the NASA Exoplanet archive: [Planetary Systems Dataset](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars).
- This JSON file contains comprehensive information about planet's orbital period, planet mass, planet radius, discovery method, and various other physical and orbital characteristics. The dataset also provides information about the host stars of these exoplanets, such as their mass, radius, temperature, and luminosity.
- Dataset Citation: NASA Exoplanet Archive. NASA Exoplanet Science Institute. Retrieved from https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars

### Running the Containerized App
- Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml.
- Build and deploy the Flask app and Redis containers: 
    - `docker-compose up --build -d`
    - This command builds the Docker images based on the Dockerfile and starts the containers, deploying the Flask app and worker in separate containers. Another container is created for the Redis database.

### Running the Integration Tests
- Navigate to the same directory containing the Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml.
- Run the following command to run the integration tests (this may take up to two minutes):
    - `pytest -v`

## Data Description
The link directs to the NASA Exoplanet Archive, a comprehensive database housing information on exoplanets—planets orbiting stars beyond our solar system. This dataset likely comprises a wealth of data regarding these distant worlds, including their names or designations, physical characteristics, and orbital properties. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a specific exoplanet, with columns representing various attributes such as mass, radius, orbital period, temperature, and distance from their respective host stars. Users can navigate through the dataset using filters and search options provided by the Exoplanet Archive interface, enabling them to explore and analyze the diverse range of exoplanetary systems discovered by astronomers worldwide.

The key fields in the Planetary Systems data were retrieved from the NASA Exoplanet Archives website found [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=PSCompPars) and are as follows:

## Software Architecture Diagram
- The software architecture diagram visualizes the Dockerized environment of the api.py Flask app running locally as well as the dockerized database and worker. Within the Docker containers, the Flask App is depicted as `api.py` running within the "flask-api-1" container. The communications between the various containers are denoted using arrows as well as the communications out of the containers to the client. The diagram also illustrates the integration tests managed by pytest running outside the docker container and the flow of data from the web to the database.
